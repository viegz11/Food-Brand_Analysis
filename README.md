## 📌 Project Overview

This individual project focuses on analyzing **customer sentiment, emotions, purchase behavior, and food brand performance** by combining **structured survey data** with **unstructured social media reviews**.

Using **Python-based NLP**, **Power BI dashboards**, and **ETL workflows**, raw customer feedback is transformed into **clear, actionable insights** that support business decision-making for food brands and restaurants.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze customer sentiment and emotions from feedback text  
- Identify top-performing food brands and popular food items  
- Understand primary purchase motivations (taste, price, health)  
- Measure recommendation likelihood based on sentiment and ratings  
- Build interactive dashboards for business intelligence  


---

## 📊 Data Sources

### 1️⃣ Structured Data (Survey)
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Region)
- Food Type, Brand, Food Item
- Ratings: Taste, Food Quality, Packaging, Overall Feedback
- Purchase motivation and recommendation intent

### 2️⃣ Unstructured Data (Social Media Reviews)
- Facebook product reviews (scraped)
- Review text data
- Sentiment score and sentiment label
- Emotion category and sentiment impact

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Merged multiple Excel files with inconsistent schemas  
- Standardized city → state → region → country hierarchy  
- Removed duplicate and invalid records  
- Handled missing values using logical rules  
- Cleaned review text (special characters, emojis, casing)  
- Normalized sentiment polarity scores between **-1 and +1**

---

## 🧠 Sentiment & Emotion Analysis

- Implemented NLP using **Python (TextBlob)**  
- Extracted:
  - **Sentiment Score** (Negative → Neutral → Positive)
  - **Sentiment Label**
  - **Emotion Category** (Trust, Anticipation, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, etc.)
- Combined text sentiment with rating-based behavior for deeper insights

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboards

The Power BI report (`FoodBrandAnalysis.pbix`) includes:

- **Food Brand & Customer Trends**
- **Product & Food Performance**
- **Customer Behavior & Purchase Drivers**
- **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**
- **Executive Review Dashboard**

### Key Insights Visualized
- Strong dominance of positive sentiment (~93%)
- Taste as the primary purchase driver
- Clear relationship between emotion and recommendation likelihood
- Brand-wise, food-item-wise, and region-wise performance analysis
